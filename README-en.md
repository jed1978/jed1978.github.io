### Icons

This theme comes with a "ginkgo leaf" icon, you can replace it with your own icon. The site's icons are located in the ./favicon.ico and ./assets/images/logo directories. You can see the logo directory has a lot of png files and a svg vector file. Those png images are actually images of different sizes generated from svg vector images that may used in some scenes, such as pinned to the screen in OS and Android and tiles in Windows 10.

This theme provides an automated script for automatically generating favicon and png files from svg vector graphics. What you have to do is:

1. Install Node.js

2. Run `npm i` command at the root directory.

3. Replacing the logo.svg file in the ./assets/images/logo directory.

4. Run `npm run artwork` command. after it finished, the favicon and png files will be replaced by the new logo.svg generated files.
